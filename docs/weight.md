### Logging Weights

There is a command line interface to log rat weights:
- To enter a new weight: `dj-ratacad weight rat_name -d yyyy-mm-dd -w rat_weight`
- To remove a weight from the database: `dj-ratacad weight rat_name -d yyyy-mm-dd -r`
- To view all weights for a rat: `dj-ratacad weight rat_name -v`

Replace `rat_name` with the name of the rat and `yyyy-mm-dd` with the date the weight was recorded.
