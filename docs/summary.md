### Daily Summaries

Every task should have a `DailySummary` summary table, with a summary of rat performance that is populated daily. There is a command line interface to quickly access this table: `dj-ratacad summary task_name -d yyyy-mm-dd`.

Replace `task_name` with the name of the task (e.g. `flashes`). The default date is yesterday, so if you want the summary of yesterday's behavior for the flashes task: `dj-ratacad summary flashes`.
